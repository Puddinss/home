                    ABOUT ME</h2>
            </div>

            <p class="">
                I am a soon-to-be graduate student at the <span class="text-amber-500">Department of Computer
                    Science</span> at the University of Turin.
                <br><br>
                I began exploring the world of the web as a teenager, initially as a user of various forums seeking
                information about video games. Eventually, I became an administrator of some of these forums, which led
                me to discover web development.<br><br>

                During high school, I had the opportunity to delve into the field of computer science and learn its
                fundamentals, ranging from <span class="text-amber-500">web developing</span> to <span
                    class="text-amber-500">software programming</span>, which laid the foundation for my
                university studies.<br><br>

                Throughout this journey, I realized that my motivation in this field
                is driven by the desire to create
                solutions that can help others. My principles are guided by <span
                    class="text-sky-500">simplicity</span>; I believe that while complex
                things can be often interesting, they are not always necessary.<br>
                That's why I enjoy helping people who rely on me, providing <span
                    class="text-sky-500">transparency</span> and <span class="text-sky-500">support</span>, meeting
                their
                needs, and aiming to advise <span class="text-sky-500">effective solutions</span> that are <span
                    class="text-sky-500">accessible</span> to any user of my content.
